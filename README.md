# Mionma.de WordPress Custom Theme
This repository was published to give you an insight into my work. If you hire me for a website development, you will get access to a similar GIT repository with your personal custom theme development.

I am against information silos and work according to the principles of collaboration.

This is a WordPress custom theme based on Advanced Custom Themes PRO and Gutenberg Block API v2.
